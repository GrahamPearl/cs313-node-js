        guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with
        you.</p>
    <p>If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the <a class="UADm2d"

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>operating and improving the services</b>, which means allowing the services to work as
                            designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated
                            systems and algorithms to analyze your content:<ul>
                                <li>for spam, malware, and illegal content</li>
                                <li>to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in
                                    Google Photos to keep related photos together</li>
                                <li>to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and
                                    personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in

                        <li><b>using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services</b>. For example, to promote
                            a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a
                            screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you
                            shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo
                            may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your
